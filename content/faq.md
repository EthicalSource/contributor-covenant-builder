# Frequently Asked Questions

We recognize that the adoption of a code of conduct can be a source of confusion or conflict for some people in online communities. This FAQ is intended to address some of the common concerns that we see raised by people whose reaction to adoption is a negative one, and we hope it will help alleviate some of their concerns.

## Isn't a code of conduct just a vehicle for promoting a progressive or left-wing agenda?
"Everything is politics", but a code of conduct is not about an advance of leftist politics. It's about establishing a minimal baseline of civil and professional collaboration. Non-discriminatory behavior should be a baseline and shared value held by people of all ideologies, regardless of political affiliation (with the obvious exception of hate groups).

## Why should my community have to change to accommodate marginalized people?
The level of accommodation that the code of conduct implies is not higher than the one that is expected when dealing with peers in other professional settings. It is not about being accommodating to one group, it's about making all potential contributors feel welcome and safe.

## Doesn't adopting a code of conduct mean that someone can be kicked out of a community for a simple mistake, holding an unpopular belief, or sharing an opinion on social media?
Contributor Covenant specifically states that behavior, actions, and communications outside the scope of the project cannot be considered violations of the code of conduct, unless the person in question is representing the project in an official capacity.

In the case of a confirmed violation, community leaders are expected to respond to a violation with a consequence that is proportional to the offense and to work with the offender to prevent future violations. Everyone wants a safe, collaborative community of bright, kind, compassionate people of all kinds. It is not in a community leader's best interests to be hostile or overly punitive to members of their community.

## Doesn't this code of conduct just promote political correctness?
Only if you define political correctness as the belief that women, non-binary people, gay, lesbian, queer, and/or transgender people, people of color, and people of different religious backgrounds should be afforded the same rights and privileges as everyone else.

## Doesn't a code of conduct give too much power to community leaders?
Project maintainers are the arbiters of code of conduct violations and are the unquestioned leaders of the projects they own. Without a code of conduct, a project maintainer has the power to eject any contributor from a project for any (or no) reason at all. A properly enforced code of conduct creates a social contract between and among contributors and maintainers that make such abuses of power less acceptable and common. If you don't trust a project maintainer to act in a just and fair way, you probably should consider not participating in their community.

## Can I be cited for a code of conduct violation for something that I say on social media?
Contributor Covenant only applies in project spaces and when an individual is representing a project. Your conduct outside of these situations is not governed by the code of conduct.

## What should I do if I have been accused of violating the code of conduct?
The first step when dealing with accusations of violation of the code of conduct is to deal with it in a professional manner. Do not respond with sarcasm, attack the code of conduct or its enforcement, or the accuser. Calmly focus on the evidence of what happened, work to understand any damage you may have caused, and examine how your intentions may have inadvertently caused harm. The more you stick to the facts of what happened, and demonstrate your willingness to work with the enforcement team as they evaluate the claim, the better. Most importantly, trust the project maintainers to act in a fair and just manner.

## Why are 'ethnicity' and 'race' called out as two separate characteristics? Aren't these terms interchangeable?

**Ethnicity** (or ethnic group) is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, history, society, culture or nation.

**Race** is the grouping of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into categories generally viewed as distinct by society and usually resulting from genetic ancestry.

We recognize different cultures and the process of translation might make the differences between these terms less apparent. Violence and discrimination can occur based on the perception of either and sometimes both at the same time which is why it is important to call them out as two separate concepts.

## Why are 'gender' and 'sex characteristics' called out as separate? Is this discriminatory against cisgender women?

Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Donec sed odio dui. Maecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna.

## Contributor Covenant explicitly lists a set of protected classes; does this make it acceptable to discriminate or make others feel unwelcome based on other factors?
No. Contributor Covenant explicitly lists protected classes for many reasons, such as reminding people to give them appropriate consideration, and assuring people in those protected classes that they are welcome. However, this is not an invitation for rules lawyers to seek loopholes, or to discriminate against others or make people feel unwelcome based on criteria not listed here. (With the notable caveat that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">those who discriminate or make others feel unwelcome are themselves not welcome</a>.)
