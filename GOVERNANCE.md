# Contributor Covenant Governance Overview

This project is managed by the members of the Organization for Ethical Source, in
accordance with its [governance structure](https://ethicalsource.dev/governance/bylaws/).

We strive to center the [Ethical Source Principles](https://ethicalsource.dev/principles/)
in all the work we do and the decisions we make.

# Mission
Contributor Covenant ignited a revolution in how we think about open source communities, and continues to be a critical component of its practice. Our mission is to guide the continued evolution of Contributor Covenant, ensuring that this foundational document continues to serve open source communities in their efforts to center justice and equity in their practices.

# Decision-making

## Lazy consensus
Most decisions, such as approval of minor copy edits or the addition of a translation, are made in public through comments on pull requests or issues on our Github repository. Decisions about such changes are presumed to pass in the absence of objections.

## Committee responsibilities
In case of major changes, or conflict that contributors cannot resolve themselves, the OES's Board has the responsibility for final decision-making.

# Code of Conduct
We strive for fair and transparent enforcement of our [code of conduct](https://github.com/EthicalSource/contributor_covenant/blob/release/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and prioritize the safety and well-being of those who are affected by a violation of our community norms and standards.
